            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That theſe Creatures have been highly Eſteemed in all Ages, and their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding very great, Hiſtory makes frequent mention; So that their Preſervation was had in much regard: And <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> and other Eminent Phyſicians, Studyed it, next to Man's, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down Rules and Methods to diſcover and cure the Diſeaſes incident to them. And this Example I have alſo follow'd, that ſo generous a Creature may at no time be loſt for want of ſuitable Remedies in any matter that may beſall him. The Station it has pleaſed God to put me in, has led me to Experience in this Creature; and I have found many things concerning them, to which, as far as I can perceive, the Ancients were Strangers:
<pb facs="tcp:35688:5"/>
I have put them into a ſuitable Method, and Incerted them in this Book, beſides what are taken from the Works of the moſt Expert Managers and Farriers that have ever been made Publick: So that I may without ſtraining a point of Modeſty, truly ſay, it not only An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, but much exceeds what is promiſed in the Title-page, and is the beſt of its kind that has hitherto been abroad in the World. To prove this, I could incert many Particulars, but they being plainly to be ſeen in reading the following Pages; and Brevity (as I conceive) always moſt commendable in a Preface, I draw to a Concluſion:</p>
            <p>As well knowing that when all that I can ſay, is ſaid, I muſt leave it to the Cenſure of the Reader, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will only deſire one Favour, (which no reaſonable Man will refuſe) and, that is, not to paſs Sentence before you Read and put in Practice ſo much of it as ſhall be ſuitable to your Occaſion. And ſo not fearing its coming to the Touch-ſtone, to prove its real Worth and Value, I remain, Reader,</p>

                  <p>HOrſes, of all the unreaſonable Creatures upon the Earth, are of the greateſt Underſtanding, having in them (as the Learned affirm) a certain natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtinct, not only of the knowledge of their Riders and Keepers, but alſo of their own Generation and Deſcent, knowing their Sires and Dams, in ſuch a manner as they will refuſe (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays) to couple or ingender with them! They are alſo Creatures the apteſt to learn any Motion, and the readieſt to obey their Teacher, having a greater love to Exerciſe than any other Beaſt. They are of an infinite great Courage, taking an exceeding delight in the Wars; and (as ſome do affirm) have a certain fore-knowledge of the Battel, and will prepare themſelves for the ſame. They will mourn for the loſs or deaths of their Maſters; and are ſo apt to indure Labour, that it is written of the Horſes of the <hi>Samarans,</hi> That they'll gallop a hundred Miles end-ways, without reſt or ſtay; they are naturally long liv'd, and by choice Keepers have been brought up to fifty Years; but for thirty it hath been ordinary with them: the Mares are ſhorter liv'd, ſurviving till twenty or twenty five at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt. They are of all Beaſts the moſt beautiful of ſhape. They are fit for the Saddle at four years of age for the Wars at ſix, for the Race at eight, for Hunting, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Matches, at ten or eleven. The Females bear their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35688:6"/>
Foal full eleven Months, and foal in the twelfth: the beſt time for their ingendering is <hi>March,</hi> at the increaſe of the Moon, or in part of it; the Mare foaleth ſtanding; they are ſuppoſed to be ſo loving and kind to their Generation, that if a Foal loſe the Dam, yet the other Mares, which are with milch, will, of their own accord, lend their teats, to feed and nurſe up the Orphan foal. Horſes are ſubject to more Diſeaſes then any other Beaſt; ſome write three hundred, or as many as belong to Man.</p>

                  <p>If the true knowledge of Hoofs were rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, then ſhooing could not be difficult: Firſt, I will ſet down what is a perfect Hoof, it muſt be lean, ſmooth, deep, tough, narrow towards the Toe, and conveniently broad in the Heels, much like an Aſſes Hoff, for it ſhould be round. A Hoof that wants the deepneſs of the Coffin cannot be of long ſervice; and becauſe all the weight of the Horſe reſteth upon the Quarters and Heels of the Fore-feet, therefore thoſe Quarters, I mean the edge of the Coffin on the hinder part of the Forefeet muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and taken off as little as may be, for thereby the Horſe treadeth and beareth equally, which is a ſpecial means to keep him from interfering behind.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35688:9"/>
let him cut out of the end of the corner of the Coffin, as near to the quick of the Heel as may be, as much of the Coffin as you may lay your Finger in it, whereby it ſhall never gather too near the Fruſh, to cloſe up, and become narrow in the Heels, ſo as when the Horſe is ſhoo'd, you ſhall have a very good diſtance betwixt the broad end of the Fruſh, and the ſponge of the Shooe, whereby all Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and Stones will waſh and work out of the ſponge of the Shooe, being cut aſlope; then when the Shooe is tacked on with nails, ſet down the Horſes Foot, and ſtand direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behind the Horſe, and view whether the Fruſh of the Foot be direct and of juſt proportion, even betwixt the Webs of the Shooes, and whether the Horſe ſtand right, and the Fruſh equally betwixt the Webs or Sponges of the Shooe, and you ſhall be aſſured thereby that the Shooe ſtandeth right, the continual uſe whereof will cauſe the Horſe to tread and traverſe boldly and ſurely, becauſe his Quarterns being the bearing place, will be broad and even to ſupport the whole Body. And for the true making of the Shooe, all the Web ſhould be ſtrait and plain, not drawn in at the Heels and Quarter narrow, or beaten to the Heels which many uſe to do, neither hallowed, if the Feet be perfect but even and flat, with a broad Web, and the Sponges thicker and more ſubſtantial than any part of the Shooe, to cauſe the Joynt to ſtand upright, and ſo wide in the Quarters as both ſides may disbord the coffin of the Hoof the breadth of a Straw, to guard and ſave the Coffin of the Hoof, being the only ſtrength of the whole Foot, and alſo the ſhooe ſo far ſet back to guard the Heels, as may ſave the ſame from bruiſing and cutting with Stones, and unleſs the Coffin be continually ſo kept open from hard oppreſſing, and cloſing of the Tuel of the Foot, which is incloſed within the Coffin, whereby the Tuel becometh bound to the great grief and lameneſs of the Horſe, but the Foot and Joynt of the Horſe maintained as a principal poſt to ſupport the whole Building, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Horſe will become Hoof-bound, which many ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly call dry foundred, and alſo make the Joynt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come weak, lame, and full of Windgalls.

when he comes to the piercing of the Shooe of the Fore-foot, let him not ſpare to pie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rce it from the Quarter to the hard Toe, but not backward to the Heel, and let the Shooe be ſo pierced, as the holes be much wider on the outſide of the Shooe then within, for the holes of the inſide of the Shooe ſhould be no wider then the Shank of the Nail may well fit, otherwiſe the Shooe will never fit faſt and ſteady, and the circle of the piercing more diſtant from the edge o'th' toe, then from the edge of the Quarter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every Smith knoweth that there is more hold to be taken with leſs danger, in reſpect of the Tuel and Quick of the Foot, and all the Nails would be untoled without Shoulders, which will ſo ſink, and ſtrongly fill the Hole, as that the Shooe will be well fixed, and by cutting the Hoof a little with the point of a Knife, let the Clin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> Writers have drawn particular Names, from whom the People borrow their Opinions, and therefore when a Horſe hath a white-foot or a white-mark, which the <hi>Italian</hi> calls <hi>Balzano,</hi> if the white extend high and large (they ſay) it pretendeth debility, becauſe whiteneſs beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenth weakneſs, dulneſs, and the like, and that they call <hi>Balzani,</hi> they tell us of <hi>Calzoti, Arteglio, Travato, Truſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vato, Rapicano, Attuſuato, Guzzo, Zuino,</hi> &amp;c. and ſure I am that neither with foot, white ſtar, white liſt, ſtrake, ſnip, phillet in the forehead, white rump, black and red flea-bytings, oſtrick-feather, where it cannot be ſeen, meal-noſe, meale-ſlank, bearded under his chops like a Goat, black and long fetterlocks, long main, black tail, black liſt, and ſuch like, are not to be depended on as the aſſurant of a good Horſe, for undoubtedly you ſhall find good and bad of all colours, but to overcome Cuſtom, is a hard fight.</p>

                  <p>A Horſe that is fearful by Nature may, by compulſary means, after long uſe make little or no ſhew of fear, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Ship upon the Sea, where are trumpets, guns, and the like, not having means to avoid the ſame, by uſe and continuance thereof, ſeemeth not fearful.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35688:12"/>
To conclude and make the truth hereof appear, chooſe a Horſe with a broad forehead, a great black full eye ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out like a Hare's, and a high rear'd forepart, and be aſſured that by Nature he is bold, and to give you a farther aſſurance, mark a Horſe with a narrow forehead, little eyes and low forepart, which is meer contrary, and aſſure your ſelf by Nature, that he is ſtarting and fearful, and to ſeal up the truth thereof, the tryal will confirm you.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall next tell how to make the Rider perfect in Stop. After he hath ended the number of his Ring-turns, which is, to trot his Horſe right out in the middle Furrow, betwixt the Rings, until he come to the place of ſtop, and there to make a pretty ſtay, keeping his Body right in the path, wherein if the whole Body or any part ſtand overthwart, ſeek not at firſt to correct him for it thro' your too much Paſſion, but let a a Foot-man direct him to ſtand right in the Path, as we ſaid before, by thruſting in that part which ſtands out of order, or that he may cauſe the Horſe to go farther in the ſame Path, and ſtop him, holding that Rein ſtreighter on that ſide whereon he moſt forceth his Head than the other, which will enforce him to keep right; which when he yieldeth, ever cheriſh him; and after it will be convenient to trot and ſtop him on a Ground that is a little ſteep, which ſomething falleth, and immediately riſeth; but when he is perfect then he may do it on a Ground very ſteep. But to teach him to go back, you muſt keep a firm ſtaid hand on him, without giving him any Liberty, and then gently ſtriking him on the Neck
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35688:20"/>
with his Rod, in that inſtant ſay, <hi>Back, back;</hi> but if he refuſe, let a Foot-man with a rod gently ſtrike him on the Knees, and ſo, by the gentle puiling in of the Rider's hand, and fair means, oblige him to it.</p>

                  <p>For, if you preſs him with the Bridle, if he carry his head well, yet muſt you preſently eaſe your Bridle-hand, and make much of him, becauſe he ſheweth himſelf obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to you and whenſoever he doth any thing well, and with delight, you muſt be very careful not to vox him, but ever ſo to win him, that he may be willing to pleaſe you.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe when he bears a firm hand with a ſtay, that thereby the Horſe brings in his head, and yields to his hand, yet he muſt ſhorten the Reins of his Bridle till his head be ſetled in its due place, that is, neither to carry his Forehead too much out nor too much in, and ſtill to maintain him in that form in all his doings, yet not ſo that it exceed mediocrity or temperature, but remain light on the hand with a ſweet mouth.</p>
                  <p>Thus having ſhew'd the Rider, that it muſt be done by keeping this order, I proceed.</p>
                  <p>Let him ſtay his Horſe temperately upon an even hand, as his reſiſtance ſhall require, without giving any other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, then with his Rod to ſtrike him gently upon the bowing of the Neck, provoking him mildly with the Spur on that ſide on which he moſt wryeth his Buttock, to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> go lightly back with both the fore Legs, when he is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35688:21"/>
touched on the Neck with the Rod, ſaying with a loud Voice, <hi>Back;</hi> at which Voice, with the feeling of the Rod and drawing of the Bridle, he will go back to the Rider's deſire: And always after, when he is out of the due and true ſtay upon the Bridle, let him do the like, that is, to go back in form aforeſaid; and altho' ſome diſorder be committed, let not the Rider deſpair, for he ſhall find him eaſily won to a good Mouth, by this uſe of a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and firm Hand, which is by the mediocrity of ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drawing, properly named <hi>a ſweet Stay,</hi> making him light upon the hand, champing the Bit with great pleaſure, and a ſtay'd Head in due place, the true Tokens whereof are juſt Reins, ſtaid, and a light-born Head with pleaſure on the Bit, being Properties inſeparable in every perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhap'd Horſe's Actions. But becauſe it may ſeem very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to have a continuance of Perfection in every action, altho' it is common upon ſtop, or ſtanding ſtill, to be in order, yet perhaps, upon motion, he will leave playing upon the Bit, and bear upon the head, eſpecially upon the main courier, which proceeds from the want of true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how to maintain and continue the hand juſt and firm with a ſweet ſtay, ſo as that he may take pleaſure on the Bit: And therefore how to maintain a Horſe both in furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and quiet doings, is to be conſider'd of: If then that at any time he make any diſorder, note it diligently, ſo ſtay him, and make him go backward; for in going back, he will bring himſelf to his right order agen: Then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make much of him, and forthwith move him forwards fair and gently, till he come to the place of ſtop. And as he muſt be thus uſed in going forward, ſo he muſt be uſed in treading of the Rings, firſt gently upon the pace, upon the trot, and upon the gallop, in practiſing whereof he muſt preciſely obſerve that it be done with a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſtaid, and firm hand, otherwiſe he will gape, thruſt his Tongue upon the Bit, or over the Bit, to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, thruſt his head out ſuddenly, pluck it in diſdainful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or elſe ſhaking or moving his head one way or other, to be freed from the preſſing of the intemperate hand, which is to him uncouth and contrary to Nature the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35688:22"/>
which Art ſhould evermore labour to pleaſe. The true form and practice of drawing the Bridle is alſo to be learnt; which is, that being mounted in the Saddle, let the Rider draw the Reins equal; and if the Horſe know not the Bit, then let the Bit be very ſlack, and let him hold the Reins in his left hand, with the little finger and Ring-finger between, under the Pummel of the Saddle, as near the Withers as he can, and then with the right hand draw the Reins ſoftly and equally together through the left hand, ſo as the Standers-by can ſcarcely perceive it, the which he muſt not remove until he feel the Horſe to ſtay upon the Bit, and there hold them without ſlacking or further drawing, until he perceive whether the Head ſtand in true form; which if it be not, then let him a little yield his left hand again, and ſtanding ſo a pretty while, bring his left hand to his former place again, where the Horſe made the firſt ſtay upon the Bit; then let him draw the Reins with his right hand ſomewhat more through the left, as before, but ſo little and gently, as, ſcarcely to be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for ſo muſt all the motions of the Hand be, and then keep it firm and ſtaid a pretty while, and if he yield, tho' very little, let him keep his hand ſtill at one ſtay, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlackening nor drawing it, whereby he will feel the eaſe that he hath got by yielding; and then preſently make much of him: But if it ſo happen, that the Reins fall ſlack, let him not remove his left hand, but draw them through his left hand, as before, for they muſt not be ſlack until they ſtay again upon his right hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto whenſoever he yieldeth, make much of him, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing ſtill in this manner to ſolicite him till his Head be in its due place, that is, neither too much out, nor too much in; after which, if he bear not light, let his Rider ſtrike him gently on the Knees of his fore Legs, to make him to go back, whereby he will bring in his head, and then will the Bit move, and his Hand find eaſe; but let him be very careful at that inſtant to keep his hand ſo firm as that he neither ſlack nor draw in, to the end he may feel and receive the eaſe of his own motion of yielding, which willingly he will not looſe, it being delightful to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35688:22"/>
his nature, but take ſome pleaſure to ſtir the Bit in his Mouth, and go backward with it; the which when the Rider finds, are tokens of the winning of his Mouth, which to his great ſatisfaction being won, with obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good order, he may be brought to a more conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nued Perfection.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have ſhew'd the expert Rider ſo much as the Art may help him; but if the Shape and Nature of the Horſe be oppoſite and repugnant, as in the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Horſes, it is to no purpoſe; howſoever, for a time it may ſeem to be taught, yet queſtionleſs it cannot be of any continuance.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe in the whole Art of Riding there is no one thing more difficult than to make a Horſe trot juſt: And that the Perfection thereof is the Perfection of all other of his Doings I purpoſe to give further Rules.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Particular Rules and Directions for the Management of a Horſe, to train him up to a good and commendable Trot, being the Foundation of all.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Let the Rider obſerve, that when he is teaching his Horſe herein, or any other Leſſon, that he do not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him with any other thing at that time, neither ſuffer him to begin to learn any other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he do not ſuffer any other to ride him until he be perfected by himſelf in ſuch Leſſons as he taught him, leſt he ſhould be confus'd by the diverſity of Teachers, and their manner of Teaching.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That when he is brought to a juſt Stay of Head, and aſſurance of the Bit, that then the Rider is to maintain him therein to a full perfection.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When he is out of order, then let him ſtay him, and make him go back, as before was mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When he is in order, then let him make much of him, and ſtay not long, but with a firm hand gently put him into his Trot again.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If he continue in his good order, cheriſh him, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Body, with a pleaſant and gentle motion of the Calves of your Legs move him to do it more expeditiouſly,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35688:23"/>
which if he be of a good nature, he will ſpeedily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; always remembering to keep a firm hand, unleſs he bring in his Head.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. if his Trot continue not light upon your hand, ſtay him, and cauſe him to go back, which will bring him in order again, and then gently put him into his Pace, and ſo to his Trot, as before; which being well done, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and delight him with all the ſweetneſs that may be, ſo that the Rider may ever win his Love thereby; guide him home by ſome leading Lines, and give him a little Graſs or Hay out of your hand; tickle, ſcratch him, and ſpeak to him moſt loving words, which will make him at his next Exerciſe do all things to his Rider's greateſt content, and within twenty days, or thereabouts, he will Pace and Trot in ſuch order, as that the Rider may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways afterwards trot him moſt ſwiftly in the Rings or in the Manage.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In his ſwift Trot, by all means keep your true Seat and firm Hand, ſo that he loſe not that excellent form and grace before preſcribed; but do not Gallop him till he be juſt and perfect in his ſwift Trot, and then out of that trot, to put him to a ſwifter gallop in the large Rings, even to the Stop: But beware you draw not your hand haſtily to you, but by a little ſway of your Body, Back and Hand together, and ſtay your hand there until he retreat a ſtep or two, and there ſtay him, and ſuffer him not to go forward, and at that inſtant to make much of him, and ſo let your hand and body reaſſume the ſame place again.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. If he ſhould then offer to go forwards, ſtay him with the like ſway, and then alight, and lead him home, making much of him, as you did before.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. I dare to aſſure the Rider of the right uſe of what hath been ſaid, and of the ſucceſs thereof, therefore let him follow his Practice, and continue it; let him pace his Horſe overthwart ſome deep Fallow as faſt as he can for half an hour, but ſuffer him not by any means to trot, keeping his hand in a firm and temperate ſtay, as before, and if he ſtill find his head in due place, his carriage
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35688:23"/>
light and pleaſant upon the Bit, he may aſſure himſelf that he hath gain'd the perfection of the Hand, and the true uſe thereof, for the teaching and making of a young Horſe; wherein obſerve, that if he be of a perfect ſhape, his Head will be in the due place, and light upon the Bit.</p>

                     <hi>Of the Manag'd Horſe, with further Inſtructions,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>I now intend to diſcourſe a little of the Horſe that is already taught, and brought to perfection; with him the expert Rider hath ſmall need to make uſe of any Rod, or other help, but to keep his true, juſt, and perfect Seat, becauſe his Horſe, by the leaſt token of the Bridle or Spur, will do all things in ſuch time and meaſure, as the Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will judge the Man and Horſe to be but one Body, one Mind, and one Will: And therefore, how the Reins ſhould be carried, placed, and uſed, is the only thing to be ſpoken of: The Reins he muſt hold in his left hand, placing the little finger betwixt the two Reins, and the thumb cloſe upon the Reins, ſo as the hand remove not from the Creſt of the Horſe, for by the motion of the hand it is ſignified to the Horſe which way you would have him turn, ſlacking it on the other: The Order and Manner whereof hath been, and is yet diverſly uſed of the beſt Horſemen, and therefore I leave it to every man's uſe, as he findeth it moſt fit. But in the running at the Tilt, where the Horſe neither doth nor can turn, the Rider muſt not draw the Bridle towards the Tilt, but only ſtrain the Rein that is next the Tilt, to make him carry his head towards it.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe the true ſhape and goodneſs of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Horſe, is it that Art attendeth and worketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in thoſe <hi>Horſes</hi> the Rules of Art have Perfection with continuance; ſo as the <hi>Horſe</hi> that is of perfect ſhape, and well trught, ſhall not endanger Wind, or Limb, or Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Body.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) His Perſon ſhall never be in peril by rearing or running away.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Nor ſhall the Rider never be grieved with heavy bearing upon his hand, but perform all with great delight.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35688:24"/>
Neither ſhall he need Canetſan, Muſrole, or Martingale, or ſuch-like, but only falſe Reins.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) And laſtly this Teaching will manifeſt the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the true Knowers and ignorant Riders, which will be perceiv'd by the Doings the <hi>Horſe</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent and expreſs when he would appear moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and thereby render both the expert Reader, not the ignorant, and himſelf, to appear moſt nobly, with ſuch delight to the Beholders, that they will ſeem to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd with it; all which is attain'd by Diſcretion, taking of Time, with Moderation and Temperance, which is little regarded, and of very few, who will rather chuſe to ride out of order, and that with ſuch extremity of Spur and Rod, that for want of Breath they commit many ſtrange Diſorders, whereby the poor Horſe is cruelly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, having no other to ride him than one without Diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>After your Horſe hath perfectly learned ſwiftly to trot, and to ſtop, and as well to go back, then ought he to be taught rightly to advance; which is by lifting up both his fore-Feet juſt and even together, like to a Goat, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above the Ground, and ſo to let them fall even and juſt twice or thrice together, the true doing whereof will cauſe him to make a juſt perfect manage, and a ready and true turn: for the attaining whereof, trot him gently forty or fifty foot in ſome plain way, then give him a juſt ſtop, which he will truly perform, becauſe be hath before perfectly learned the ſame; let him always keep a ſteady, pleaſant, and perfect hand on the Bridle, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, with a mild Voice, ſay, <hi>Hup, hup,</hi> ſtriking him at that inſtant with his Wand on the right Shoulder, and alſo with both the Calves of the Legs together, but ſpur him not, if poſſibly without it he will advance; and this with a little labour and patient teaching, no doubt but he will attempt to do twice or thrice together, which if he do, then in that inſtant make much of him (although he did it very meanly) then let him pauſe a little time, and give him breath, and trot him again in the ſame manner the like diſtance of ground, and as before, ſo gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35688:24"/>
uſe him again; but if he do not better every time he is taught, he muſt be ſtill ſolicited until he do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>And after that he can in plain ground perfectly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, then teach him gently, upon the hanging knole of a Hill, to bring him perfectly to ſtop, and run ſliding upon his Buttocks or hinder Legs, which is very handſom, beautiful, and graceful for Manage and Turn; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let him do it before he is taught any other Leſſon then what is ſhown; and when he will do it upon a ſoft trot, upon the ſwift trot, and afterwards upon a ſoft gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, and not before, but never upon a ſwift gallop, until he be perfect both in Turn and Manage. If he advance too high, and not juſt and even, with a good grace, as he ought, then may the fault ſpeedily be found, and eaſily amended by immediately correcting him with one even ſtroke over his Legs, the Wand again order'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd out of his ſight, with a ſweet ſtaid hand on the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle<hi>:</hi> Few Tryals will ſoon amend and perfect what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in the Horſe.</p>
                  <p>And whereas ſome appoint many helps for Horſes that are harder to turn on the one ſide than on the other, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I confeſs their general Deſire is more apt to the left hand than to the right) yet to a Horſe of good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and perfect ſhape, a little Art will ſpeedily teach him to teach others.</p>

                  <p>After he is very perfect in thoſe I have ſet down, he is to make a true and a juſt half and double turn, which ſhould be in this manner: Firſt, when the Rider hath gently trotted, ſtopped, and advanced his Horſe the length of a ſhort Coureir, let him teach him gently and midly to make the half turn, (beginning always on the right hand) that is, for the Rider to turn him with the help of his left Leg, that his Head may ſtand that way which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35688:25"/>
before his Tail ſtood; it is called a half-turn, becauſe he maketh but half a circle; but if in the turn he ſet his Head that way it ſtood at the firſt, that is a whole circle, and therefore called a whole-turn: But let him firſt do the half-turn perfect, which muſt be done by helping him with his Voice and Calf of his Leg, and not at firſt by any means to have him ſpurred, if he can be otherwiſe brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, becauſe a Spur is a correction which is not to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but at that inſtant when he hath committed an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and not while he remains ignorant what to do, by which means undoubtedly, being a ſenſible Creature, he will perceive his Errors and Offences, whereby with little correction he will eaſily amend any Fault: Let the Rider never go about to make him deſpair, but continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him; for having formerly attain'd a perfection of a juſt, even and ſwift Trot in the Rings, (the very true ground of all other Leſſons,) he will eaſily turn on the right hand, ſetting his Head that way his Tail ſtood; the which being perfectly attained, then cloſe it up with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther half-turn on the ſame hand, with the perſcrib'd helps, ſetting his Head and all his Body in the ſame way it was at firſt; ſo give him Breath, and make much of him, then mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. That he do it after the firſt bound of advancing, and after the ſecond or third bound.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. After he is perfect, as aforeſaid, give him on each hand three whole turns, whereof let the firſt be very fair and ſoftly, beginning at the right hand, and ending at the right; in performing whereof, the Rider muſt always help him with his Tongue, his Rod and his Leg, by which

Or, when he manageth with the whole-reſt, and turns him at the third bound, or manage him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reſt, by turning him immediately upon the Stop, without any tarryance or reſt at all, which only is moſt common with us in <hi>England;</hi> and yet the managing of the

half-reſt is moſt neceſſary for the attaining of perfection; doth not the Rider keep and maintain the Horſe in one path, one place of ſtop, making him keep his Ground, and therein became his Head, Neck, Legs, and his Body juſt, cloſing his turn roundly, and in a narrow room, with true time and meaſure in every action, as he hath been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught? How then can managing be properly refer'd to one only Action, when it is the perfect acting of every action and Leſſon he hath learned, wherein when the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Horſe is moſt ready and perfect, he may encreaſe the often doing of his Leſſons as he will, and make an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Turns and Exerciſes, to find out the truth of his Obedience: and when they are firſt artificially, and then exactly perform'd, then may the Rider be truly ſaid to be a perfect Manager.</p>

                  <p>He is to be taught his Manage with a ſoft Trot, and not with a Gallop; my reaſon is, becauſe thereby he may be at the firſt ſenſible of Apprehending what he is to do, and how to do, and that gracefully, by the bowing of his Hoofs behind, by turning round with the <hi>Chambetta,</hi> which is by holding up the fore foot on the ſide he ſhould turn, whilſt he brings over the contrary Leg, and ſetteth it not down until he have cloſed his turn, ſo as thereby he ſhall carry both his fore-feet above the ground, not trayling upon the ground, which is diſgraceful.</p>
                  <p>When the Rider teaches his Horſe (which is after he can ſtop well) let him advance before, and turn readily on both hands, then with a ſoft Trot come to the place of ſtop about twenty paces in length, and make him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance twice together, and at the ſecond bound turn him on the right hand, (for on that hand you muſt always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) helping him ſo, that by bowing his Hoofs behind, he move his forepart orderly, then immediately in a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35688:26"/>
manner trot him back to the place that you came from, and then there, after he hath made his ſtop, at the ſecond bound of his advancing, turn him on the left hand, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like order until the Rider has gone ten or twelve times, and at the laſt cauſe him to advance twice together. And thus much for the half-reſt, which is to advance thrice, and at the third bound to turn; but be ſure he be perfect in one Leſſon before you teach him another.</p>
                  <p>In all the Rider's Managings, let his body ſtill accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany his Horſe with a good Grace; and when that he hath very perfectly learned his Manage on a ſoft Trot, then he may manage him with a Gallop, giving him on each hand one ſingle turn; and a little before he is turned, let the Rider hold his Wand on the contrary ſide, whereby he will know on what ſide to turn; and at the ſtop let the Rider make him to advance, either with his Voice, Rod, or Spur, always being careful to give him breath, evermore beginning with a gentle Gallop until he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but I wiſh the Rider ſo to uſe and exerciſe his Horſe, that he may be long Maſter of a good and perfect Horſe, and not to ſpend or ſpoil him in a little time, in teaching him needleſs toys, as ſome ignorant Perſons uſe to do.</p>
                  <p>After the Horſe is perfect in ſuch Leſſons as have been formerly taught, and is grown to his full and perfect ſtrength, then let the Rider begin him with a ſhort Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reir, in a fair ſandy way, and with a lively Voice put him forward, forcing him to run ſwiftly, roundly, and ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with a ſteddy Head, and lightly to ſtop himſelf on his Buttocks; then let him turn him on the left hand, and ſoftly pace him to the other end of the Coureir-path, and there ſtop him, and turn him again to the right hand, and ſo leave off and reſt him. And as this paſſing Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reir or ſwift Gallop muſt never be done or taught, until the Horſe be moſt perfect in all the Leſſons; ſo muſt it be done very ſparingly and ſeldom, as once or twice in a month at the moſt. <hi>of</hi>

                  <head>Of the Bound, Leap, and Yerk.</head>
                  <p>Some have a deſire for to have their Horſes to Bound, Leap and Yerk; and tho' I know it might be moſt axact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done by the beſt-ſpirited Horſes, but tending altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their deſtruction, and a matter rather of fooliſh delight than of any uſe, I leave it to the diſpoſition of the Owner, wiſhing much rather to have ſuch dangerous Exerciſes omitted than practiſed, unleſs that there were more plenty of Horſes that are fit for the ſame, or to be ſpared to be utterly ſpoiled: Therefore let not my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der admire that he meets here with ſo ſhort Remarks on them.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of the Caperiole and Corvette.</head>
                  <p>The difference betwixt theſe two, is, that the <hi>Caperiole,</hi> or Goats-leap is always in going forwards, and the <hi>Corvette</hi> ſtill in one place: Theſe are to be learned and taught by one Order, but neither of them will ever be learned, and therefore never exactly done, unleſs the Horſe be very perfect for to ſtop, which muſt be much bending of the Elbow of the hinder Hoofs or Heels of the Horſe. Now the <hi>Corvette</hi> may, in ſome ſort, reſemble the dancing of the Bear at a Stake; for when he danceth and pranceth up and down in one place, lifting his forefeet even and juſt together, ſeeming to turn if he might be ſuffer'd; that of the Bear is a proper reſemblance of the <hi>Corvette,</hi> the which is never well done, unleſs the Horſe be juſt and ſteady of Head and Body, bowing the hams of his hinder Legs, as if he would ſit or ſlide on his Buttocks. And the <hi>Caperiole</hi> is in the ſame manner, but ſtill going forwards, ſeeming as though he would yerk behind, by advancing his rump, but doth not; and as he doth it forward, ſo will he do it backward and ſide-long.</p>
                  <p>Now the Rider need not to teach his Horſe either of theſe, until, as hath been ſaid, he be abſolutely perfect in thoſe Leſſons formerly mention'd, becauſe theſe Leſſons are only learned by ſtopping and advancing; the which if he have once perfectly and long practiſed, the Trot him ſundry days upon ſome hanging Ground, and upon
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35688:27"/>
the knole of the Hill on the ſame ground; make him to advance twice together, the which he will do, and then help him with the ſound of your Lips, to trot two paces farther, and there to ſtop and advance twice together at the end of the two paces all the length of a hanging Hill downwards, ſtill remembring to cheriſh him when he does well, and to give him breath, that all his Performances may be done with delight. And if he be helped with the word, ſaying, <hi>hup,</hi> and with the Rider's Rod, by ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him upon the fore-part of his Shoulders, he will go from ſtop to ſtop, advancing both the fore Feet and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Loyns, with time and meaſure, as often as the Rider pleaſes, and in ſuch a juſt, even and ſtaid a manner as will be very pleaſant to the Beholders.</p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe I would not have the young Rider to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin any Leſſon, but by the direction of a perfect Maſter, and in that courſe to continue, ſo muſt the young Rider endeavour with himſelf to know the reaſon of all his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices; and therefore he muſt be ſure to be preſent at the Exerciſes of tho moſt skilful Horſemen, and, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let his Foot tread often upon their Threſhold;</hi> let him be acquainted with the beſt Practitioners, and when he is able rightly to judge, and to make a true difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and bad, then let him practiſe as often as he can, and never doubt to become a <hi>Perfect Horſeman,</hi> ſo as to be able to teach whatſoever is fit for a <hi>Horſe</hi> to do, and a <hi>Young Gentleman</hi> to know.</p>

                  <p>The ſtrait Turns are when he keeps his Buttocks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or cloſe to the Center or Poſt, and bearing about, makes the Circumference with his fore-part advancing a little toward the Enemy, that would avoid him.</p>
                  <p>To do the firſt, called the ſtrait Turn, faſten a Rein to a ring in the middle of your Cavezan, about three Yards

Thus uſe him on the one hand till indifferent perfect, then change the Rein to the other on the outward ring of the Cavezan and ſo in the like manner teach it him on the other hand; and by ſo doing Morning and Evening, you may ſoon bring him to it with a touch of your Switch; obſerve as he ſwiftly Trots round, that he place his outward fore-Leg over the inward, and ſo by degrees, in his Wheeling, oblige him to mend his pace ſwiftly and diſtinctly, and in as direct a Compaſs as can eaſily or conveniently be performed, till at laſt he flie with ſuch celerity, that his fore and hinder Legs move equal.</p>
                  <p>This Leſſon perfectly learned, Mount, and let one hold the long Rein, and another the ſhort one, and then with the motion of your Hand upon the left Rein of the Cavezan and Bit, bearing him Head from the Poſt, and by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Calves of your Legs and Switch upon his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Thigh, cauſe him to bear his hinder parts to the Poſt, and Exerciſe him till he perform it as well with you on his Back as he did before; then take away the Cavezan, and Exerciſe only with the ſhort Rein: And ſo having brought him to do it at the Poſt, he will be induced to do it in the open Field without one.</p>

The ſtrait Turn in keeping his Face to the Poſt as the Centre, and ſwiftly flying about with his hinder parts, the Reins both long and ſhort, muſt be uſed as before, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you muſt not give the ſhort Rein any ſcope, but darw it nearer to the Poſt; ſtill as he moves about, follow his hinder parts with the long Rein, and obſerve in his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether he bear his hinder Legs one over the other, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By the help of your Rod making him bring his hinder part ſwiftly round the Poſt, and when he is perfect, Mount him, and cauſe him to move ſwift or ſlow, ſometimes at the Poſt, and then in open Ground, as you ſee convenient: Theſe will accompliſh him for the Wars, Racing, Hunting, and other Matters.</p>

                  <p>Obſerve as to the fitneſs of pace, the Horſe's motion of his Legs when he takes them from the Ground, and you will perceive in his croſs moving what he is properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for. <hi>Viz.</hi> If his hinder and fore Leg move together then at one and the ſame inſtant, and in this motion the nearer he takes up his Limbs from Ground, the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, evener and ſhorter is his Tread; but if he do it unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſlovenly, and in a ſhuffling manner, that denotes Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, Lameneſs, or ſome ſuch Imperfection. If he tread Croſs or Narrow, it ſignifies he is ſubject to Interfering and will hardly be enduced ever to Tread ſure. If he takes his ſteps Askew and Uneven, it denotes him ſubject to Faint and Tire, unable to perform long Journeys or hard Service. If he treads Long, it ſignifies him ſubject to Strains and Over-reaches: And therefore a moderate even pace, and the clever carrying of a Horſe's Legs is to be choſen, that your labour in Teaching may mot be thrown away.

which muſt move juſt Even, Smooth and Swift, for if the Horſe tread falſe or a wry, it takes away much of the eaſineſs of his Pace; and if Short, then no more Ground is ridded than if he went a round Foot-pace: If he treads Rough, it denotes Rouling in a ſhuffling manner, and is a falſe Pace, which had been taught him by an Unskilful Hand, and he will be apt to fall out of it into a Trot, or in a ſhort time forget it.</p>

This I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a deſign not ſo much to rob a Gentleman of half a Year's Pleaſure, as to put him to treable Charges, to the advantage of ſuch who undertake to look to, and order Running-Horſe's; and therefore I thought fit to Undeceive ſuch as have been Impoſed on, by plainly laying down a nearer, leſs Chargeable, and more eaſie Method, altogether as ſafe and Effectual. <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you deſign to Match your Horſe, conſider well the State of his Body, and do it not inconſiderately; and this may be obſerved in three Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) If he be Foul or Fat, or newly taken from Graſs or Soil.</p>

                  <p n="3">(3.) Take notice, if he has had good Uſage, moderate Exerciſe, and be in good Eſtate and Plight;</p>
                  <p>And from theſe obſerve in the firſt Caſe, to take a longer time for Keeping, Matching, and bringing him into good Order, fit for Running, which indeed if long, is the moſt violent of Exerciſe; in this caſe get two Months, or if you can ſomething more.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond Eſtate of the Horſe's Body, you need not take ſo long a time, eſpecially in caſe only of Leanneſs, becauſe the Greaſe cannot injure him, and you may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe him with his Feeding, that is, at all ſeaſonable times.</p>
                  <p>In the third Eſtate, which I conſider as a Mean between the other Extreams, he may be Dieted for the Match in a Month or six Weeks. But to come nearer to my purpoſe, I allow two Months to be a ſufficient time to prepare a Horſe under any of theſe Eſtates of Body to run a Match; and theſe for the better leading to the end of what I purpoſe, may properly be divided into ſhorter Periods of time, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>When he has ſtood in the Houſe and you intend him for Graſs, abate or change his Cloaths, putting him on daily thinner, that by degrees he may be weaned from them, and, in the end, wearing none, take no notice of it, or be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd with Cold, or blaſts of Wind abroad.</p>
                  <p>This done, let him Blood twice or thrice, there being a day or two's reſpit between; give him heartning Meats; by degrees leſſen his Allowance; and in the end let him for two or three days before you ſend him out, feed on Hay alone, and put not any valuable or tender Horſe into wet Paſtures, where Foggs, Damps, and unwholſom Airs ariſe, from Fens, Marſhes, Ditches, Rivers, Bogs, or the like.

                  <p>He that will be expert in Ordering a Horſe, muſt not be unskilful in knowing the parts from whence Defects and Diſeaſes chiefly ariſe; the moſt material I ſhall briefly Enumerate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt.</hi> Conſider the Seat of Life to be in the Brain, Heart and Liver, from whence it contributes to, and diſpoſes every Member, and for that cauſe, thoſe are called the Three principal Members; to which, ſome would add a Fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> The Stones: But that Addition by the wiſeſt Practitioners has been rejected, becauſe if taken away, Life ſtill remains, which it is impoſſible to do if any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be removed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> The Sinews, which are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Two white Sinews or Tendons, beginning at the Noſe, and paſſing through the Neck and Back, branch into the fore-Legs, and end in the hinder Legs, taking their Ligaments in all the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:35688:38"/>
four Feet. Two Sinews called the main Sinews, which deſcend from the Brain, and paſſing down the Cheeks, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the Jaws. Three from the Shoulder to the firſt Joynt of the Arms or fore-legs, beſides two other great Sinews. Four great Sinews from the Knees to the Paſterns, with the ſame number in the hinder part above. As well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as without the fore-part of the Breaſt, are ten Sinews ſmall and great. From the Reins of the Back to the Stones, are four great Sinews or Ligaments, and another great Sinew running to the end of the Tail. To conclude, a Horſe has great and ſmall, Twenty Nine; or, as ſome will have it, Thirty.</p>

                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The Veins through which the Blood Circulates the whole Body, are many; yet ſeeing they centre in the Liver, the Seat and Fountain of Blood, diſtributing it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every part; divers are of opinion, that all other Veins in the Horſe's Body, are but branches of the <hi>Median Vein,</hi> proceeding directly from the Liver, and when-ever that is afflicted with Wind, has the Blood corrupted in it, or is ſubject to any other Infirmity, it afflicts all at once, the whole Body of the Horſe.</p>

                  <p>As Fire, Air, Water and Earth produce and give Life and Nutriment to all Living Creatures, ſo the Humours, <hi>viz.</hi> Choler, Blood, Phlegm, and Melancholly, are the principal Agitators in the Bodies of all Creatures, and, as it were, Compoſe, or at leaſt Preſerve them: Choler, by reaſon of its heat being alluded to Fire: Phlegm, by reaſon of its Moiſture and Coldneſs, to Water: Blood, by reaſon of its heat and Moiſture, to Air: And Melancholly, through its cold and dryneſs, to Earth.</p>
                  <p>Choler has its Seat near the Liver, which by reaſon of its heat and dryneſs accords with the Blood which has its Fountain in the Liver, and from thence diſperſeth it ſelf through the Body.</p>
                  <p>Phlegm has its chief Seat about the Brain, which is a principal Seat of Life, and frequently afflicts when out of temper, with Rheums, Colds, Coughs, Catarrhs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melancholly</hi> has its Seat about the Spleen, being the groſs and earthly part of the Blood and Choler. As for the Offices and Diſpoſitions of theſe Humours, they are four; <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>

                     </gap>ody, then he is fit for Labour or any Exerciſe: but if he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35688:40"/>
be ſad, heavy, or dejected in Countenance, do not Labour him until you have found the Cauſe, and removed it. Secondly, let not your Horſe eat any thing for two or three hours before you travel him, and then not much until you come to your Lodging; for baiting at Noon is naught and hurtful, except you reſt four or five hours, ſo as that he may not travel upon a full Stomach, and let his Bit be ſmall, and be ſure he never wear a ruſty Bit or Snaffle, for fear of the Canker. Thirdly, let your Travel be moderate, except neceſſity (which cannot be limited) enforce it; then be ſure not to let your Horſe either eat or drink until he be very cold; and if it be in Winter-time, be ſure to cloath his Head and Breaſt very warm after your Travel; and every Morning either ſquirt a little Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar into his Noſtrils, or elſe rub them with Oyl of <hi>Bay,</hi> with a Cloath nointed therewith faſtned to the end of a Stick, and thruſt up and down him Noſtrils to purge his Head. Fourthly, neither waſh nor Water your Horſe (eſpecially in the Winter-time) for when he is very hot, to walk him in the cold Air is dangerous, and waſhing is a ſpeedy Preparative to bring him to ſome dangerous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe; for there is no deſperate Diſeaſe incident to a Horſe, but the fame proceeds from the Cauſes of too much Heat or Cold; and none more dangerous then this. Fiftly, when you travel, alight often from your Horſe (if Cauſe of Neceſity enforce not the contrary) and lead him to ſome place of Graſs, Straw, or Brakes, and there ſtay and whiſtle until your Horſe Piſs, which he will hardly do except it be in ſuch places, becauſe the ſprinkling of his Water will ſcald his Legs. Sixthly, if your Horſe be very hot, let him not drink cold Water, but rather at ſome Houſe give him a quart of good Beer, or a pint of Wine; and if you do Water him by the way, let him not drink until he have waſhed his Mouth, which is done when he thruſteth his Head into the Water, preſently pull up his Head which will cleanſe his Mouth; and if you are forced to let him drink, ride him ſo that he may be ſure to keep the ſame Heat he was in before. Seventhly, After his Labour, if you can have a convenient place, let

travell'd when young, before he was cleanſed from his Humours; that he hath been travell'd when he was full; that he might alſo have too much Reſt, and was not kept with moderate Diet; that he fed too much on green Meat; that he waſhed after Labour, and ſuch like. But if the Horſe be naturally fleſhly-limbed he will never be free, but as ſoon as he is cured upon Travel he will ſwell again, and therefore ſuch Jades ſhould be gelt and put to Cart, and never ſuffered to get Colt. The Cure is divers; Take of <hi>Mallows</hi> three or four handfuls, <hi>Roſe-cake</hi> and <hi>Sage</hi> a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, boil them in Water, and thereunto put half a pound of <hi>Butter,</hi> and half a pint of <hi>Sallet-Oyl;</hi> being made warm, waſh him twice a day for three or four days.</p>

                  <p>The preventing of inward Sickneſſes, conſiſteth in two ſpecial Obſervations and Conſiderations: <hi>Firſt,</hi> To prevent it before it come, that it may not offend at all. The <hi>Second</hi> is, To take it at the firſt appearance, and ſo to prevent it,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:35688:81"/>
that it ariſeth not to any great danger or hazard. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Sickneſs, that it offend not your Horſe at all. Tho' I have already treated on this Subject, yet I ſhall not omit to write what is of excellent concernment to the Practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner. When you put your Horſe to Graſs, every three or four days before you turn him out, take blood from his Neck-Vein, then the next day after, give him a pint and a half of <hi>Muſcadine,</hi> and half an ounce of the Powder of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penthe,</hi> or three quarters of an ounce of the <hi>Horſe-Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date,</hi> and then by degrees to abate his Cloaths. You ſhall alſo obſerve, when you let your Horſe blood, to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the quantity you take from him, according to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or badneſs of the Blood, for the loſs of good Blood, is unwholſome, and doth hurt; and to preſerve ill Blood, is dangerous and noiſome. Alſo, if you obſerve when you take Blood from your Horſe, to receive it into a Veſſel, and ſtir it about continually, as the Horſe bleedeth, to keep it from clotting; then having bled him, take the Blood and beſmear it all over the Horſe's Back and Body, you ſhall find it wonderful wholſome to him, for it comforteth his Body, cleareth his Skin, and breedeth a rejoycing in all the Horſe's internal parts. Now if you have no determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to put your Horſe to Graſs, and yet you would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent inward Sickneſs, then you ſhall obſerve once in two or three Months, (when you have the beſt leiſure to reſt your Horſe after it) not to fail to give him <hi>Muſcadine</hi> and <hi>Diapenthe,</hi> and <hi>Horſe-Mithridate,</hi> as was before ſhewed, and not to let him Blood at all; for this very Potion is the greateſt purger and purifier of the Blood that can be, and voideth all that yellow Cholerick Matter, and other evil and undigeſted Humours, which corrupt the Blood. Now you are to obſerve here, that although I only preſcribe <hi>Muſcadine,</hi> wherein you ſhall diſſolve your Powder, or <hi>Mithridate;</hi> yet know, that when you cannot get <hi>Muſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> or other ſweet Wine, that then you may take ſtrong Ale, or Beer, but in a greater quantity; for whereas you take but a pint and a half of Wine, you ſhall take of Beer or Ale, a full Ale-quart; as for the Powder of <hi>Mithridate,</hi> you ſhall keep the firſt quantity already preſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:35688:82"/>
if you warm your Beer or Ale a little on the Fire, it will not be amiſs, but better. Now to take a Sickneſs at the firſt Approach, and to prevent it, that it may not ariſe not to any great danger, you ſhall by all means obſerve to look well into the Occaſions of Sickneſſes, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed, and into the Signs of thoſe Occaſions; and if you find your ſelf guilty of any of them, or that the Horſe diſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I will now deſcend to the Cure of theſe inward Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: And though every ſeveral Sickneſs have a ſeveral Cure, yet I will draw all here into one ſudden, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and infallible proved Method, ever found proſperous and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fortunate. Whenſover, by Signs before rehearſed, or other Accident or Knowledge, you ſhall find your Horſe grievouſly pained with inward Sickneſs, the firſt thing you ſhall do open his Neck-Vein, and receive ſome of the firſt Blood into a Pewter Porringer, which, if you ſet it in cold Water, will preſently diſcover the Foulneſs and Putrefaction; then let the Horſe bleed well till the Blood change; neither muſt you be nice or tender-in this Action, becauſe you muſt underſtand that all inward Sickneſſes in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:35688:82"/>
Horſes draw their Effects from the Putrefaction of the Blood only. And this is the Reaſon. It is certain that the Horſe, of all other Creatures, hath no natural Veſſel into which to receive the ſcummy and putrefied matter which ariſeth from corrupt and Cholerick Blood, but it is either voided in Excremental Humours, or moderate Exerciſe and Sweats, or elſe by immoderate Exerciſe and violent Labour. By too much Repletion and Fulneſs, by unwholeſome Food and evil Diet, or by ſome other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Defect, this Cholerick Corruption increaſing and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing, it preſently, and in an inſtant overſpreads the whole Body, having its Courſe through every Vein, and ſo diſcoloureth the Skin, and makes all the outward parts yellow, eſpecially the Eyes and inſide of the Lips; alſo mixing with the better Blood, and confounding the Strength and Vertue thereof, it brings a general Fairneſs over the Body, and in the end ſuffocateth the Heart; of force there muſt follow ſudden and certain Mortality; and hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thoſe ſudden Deaths of Horſes, for which our weak Farriers can give but a fooliſh and idle Account. But to return to the purpoſe; after you have taken away good ſtore of Blood, and (as you imagine) all, or at leaſt, the moſt part of that which is corrupt, then ſet him up in the Stable, tying his Head to the Rack gently, and at Liberty, neither ſo high that he ſhall be compelled to reſt his Head upon the Bridle, nor yet ſo low, that he may thruſt hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

At high Noon you ſhall give him a ſweet Maſh of Malt and Water made in this manner: Take half a peck of good Malt well ground, and put it into a Pale by it ſelf, then take a Gallon of fair clear Water, and ſet it on the Fire; then when it is come to the hight, that it is ready to boyl, put as much of it to the Malt as will moiſt and cover the Malt all over, and ſtir them exceeding well together, cruſhing the Malt with a flat Rudder as much as you can, ever and anon taſting it with your Finger, till it be as ſweet as any Honey, and then cover it over as cloſe as you can, and ſo let it ſtand and ſtove for two or three hours at the leaſt; then the hour being come in which the Horſe is to receive it, uncover the Maſh and ſtir it about; but finding it to hot, then put to it ſome clear cold Water, that may temper and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it, but in any wiſe not ſo much as may take away any part of the Sweetneſs; and in this tempering, with your hand cruſh and ſqueeze the Malt as much as you can; the Maſh being lukewarm, give it to the Horſe to drink; and if he eat of the Malt, let him take thereof at his Pleaſure. This is the beſt manner of making of an ordinary Maſh, or Horſe-Caudle, for it is of that nature and quality; and to that purpoſe that a Caudle is adminiſtred to Man, is this given to a Horſe; for you muſt underſtand, that in theſe contagious Diſeaſes, nothing is more peſtilent than cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and eſpecially when that Exerciſe cannot be uſed. The ruder Farriers and Horſe-Grooms, do make the Maſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way, putting the Malt to the Water at the firſt, and ſo boyling them both together; but this is unwholſom and nought, and that every good Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſwife can witneſs; for this long boiling over-ſcalds the Malt, and takes away the Strength and Sweetneſs, and gives a harſh and unſavory Taſte, which is offenſive to the Horſe's Nature. If your Horſe be coy, and refuſe to take the Maſh, as many are, partly for want of Uſe and Cuſtom, and partly for Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:35688:83"/>
of Stomach, than you ſhall ſtrain the Water from the Malt exceeding hard, and ſo give him with a Horn to drink; then take the Grains which you have ſo ſtrained, and put them in the Manger before the Horſe, on which, whether he feed or no, it matters not; for if he but ſmell and ſnuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle his Noſe upon them, it is ſufficient; for the Fume there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is wonderous wholeſome for his Head. After you have given him the Maſh, ſee that he be warmly cloathed, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a good Woollen Body-cloath to come round about his Heart, a large Cloath or two to come over it, and to be wiſpt round about, with ſoft, thick, and large Whiſps; for the little, hard, and neat Wiſps, though they are comely to the Eye, yet they are unwholſome for the Body, for Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Smallneſs makes an Impreſſion into the Horſe's ſides, cauſeth him to forbear to lye down, when Nature and Reſt requireth it. The Horſe being thus warm cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you ſhall then cauſe one or two to rub all his four Legs from his Knees and Lamtrels downwards, with very hard Whiſps, and to rub them as hard as may be; and whilſt his Limbs are thus in rubbing, take a coarſe Rubber or two, made of new hardned temper Cloath, and warming one after another over a pan of Coals, with them rub the Horſe exceedingly much in the Nape of his Neck, and the Pole, juſt betwixt his Ears, and on the Temples of his Head; for there is nothing that is more wholeſome than theſe Frictions and Chaſings, for they diſſolve Humours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive all natural Heat, being a cheerful Nimbleneſs to the Limbs, and purge the Head of groſs Cold, and rough Matter, cleanſing and purifying the Brain, by which the Members and other Faculties are fortified, and the whole Body reduced back to its full Strength and Ability. As ſoon as you have ended this Friction of rubbing, you may then let the Horſe take his Reſt for two or three hours, and only leave a Lock or two of ſweet Hay in his Rack, and no more; for the leaſt quantity of any thing is too much, and ſoon cloys a ſick Horſe.</p>

This Accident, when at any time it happeneth, it ſhall be good for you firſt to rake him, then anoint your Hand all over with <hi>ſweet Butter,</hi> or clarified <hi>Hogs-greaſe:</hi> Some uſe Oil of <hi>Bay;</hi> but it is too ſharp and too hot, and many times (if the action be uſed too roughly, or unadviſedly) it breedeth an exulceration or ſoreneſs in the I all and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts: Therefore either take <hi>ſweet Butter</hi> or <hi>Hogs-greaſe,</hi> and your hand being all beſmeared therewith, thruſt it up into his Tuel until you feel his Ordure, then draw out as much thereof (if it be black) as conveniently you can; alſo, take a great Candle of three or four in the Pound at leaſt, and cutting off an Inch or two at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or ſmaller end, with your Hand anoint as before, thruſting the great end forward, put it up into his Tuel ſo far as you can get it; then ſuddenly drawing out of your Hand, and leaving the Candle behind you, clap down his Tail cloſe to his Tuel, and drawing it up between his Legs, hold it with your Hand hardly and conſtantly for the ſpace of an hour or more, in which time the Candle will diſſolve in the Horſe's Body, and ſo ſeparate and break his Ordure, and upon the letting looſe of your Hand, he will preſently Dung. This you may do in every caſe of Extremity, but not otherwiſe: And believe it, you will find this the moſt excellent Suppoſitory of all other; and there is no Gliſter that can work with greater efficacy or more wholſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                  <p>There is another Accident which attendeth the Sickneſs of Horſes, and this is quite contrary to that before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and it is called Laxativeneſs, or Looſeneſs of the Body, which is expreſſed by a vehement and violent Scowring: This, if at any time it ſhall happen, you ſhall at firſt note
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:35688:86"/>
the violence thereof, and the continuance thereof. The violence is known by the thinneſs or ſharpneſs, and the often and ſpeedy voiding of the Excrements. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance is known by the unchangeableneſs of the Infirmity, and by the proceſs and long continuance of time, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all natural and wholſome cuſtom; for you are to obſerve, that a Horſe may have a Scowring for a day, or a little more, and this is not unwholſome, but natural and good; and if after, it ſtay of it ſelf, then it worketh no evil effect; but if it continue longer, and bring the Horſe into an extraordinary weakneſs of Body, then ſeek to ſtop it in this manner: Take a quart of <hi>Milk,</hi> putting thereto a good ſpoonful or two of fine <hi>Bean-flower,</hi> and as much <hi>Bole-Armoniack</hi> finely beaten to Powder, boyl altogether till the Milk thicken, and then being made luke-warm, give it the Horſe with a Horn; and doing thus a Morning or two, no doubt but that it will Bind the Horſe; which if it doth not, then you ſhall take a quart of <hi>Red-wine,</hi> and put thereunto a handful of the Herb call'd <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s <hi>Purſe,</hi> and half ſo much of <hi>Tanner</hi>'s <hi>Bark,</hi> and boyl all very well together, till the Herb and the Bark be ſoft; then ſtrain it, and put thereinto of the Powder of <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made lukewarm, give it to the Horſe to drink with a Horn; and this do a Morning, two or three, if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>

in the beſt Spirited Horſes, if you then perceive their Actions, how heavy they perform them at ſuch times. The manner of purging and clearing the outward parts of the Body, ſhould be in this manner.
